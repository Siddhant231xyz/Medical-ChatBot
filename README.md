# Medical Chatbot with Appointment Booking

Welcome to the **Medical Chatbot with Appointment Booking** project! This interactive, Streamlit-powered application serves as a cutting-edge virtual medical assistant. It leverages state-of-the-art language models alongside retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to answer users' medical questions using a trusted medical reference and, when needed, smoothly guides users through an appointment booking process.

## Overview

This project integrates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a simple appointment scheduling flow. The Medical Chatbot reads a trusted medical reference (a PDF book), splits it into manageable chunks, and indexes the knowledge using vector stores. When users ask a question, the chatbot retrieves the most relevant information and generates a concise, empathetic, and disclaimer-included answer.

The appointment booking module adds another layer of interactivity by allowing users to seamlessly transition from asking questions to scheduling appointmentsâ€”all within one intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic Medical Q&A:**  
  Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide answers based on the most relevant information from a medical reference PDF.
  
- **Empathetic Chat Interface:**  
  Built on Streamlit, the chatbot offers a user-friendly web interface designed to engage and inform users.
  
- **Appointment Booking Integration:**  
  Easily switch to an appointment booking flow by typing keywords like "appointment" or "book". Users can then provide their details and receive a simulated appointment confirmation.
  
- **Cutting-Edge Technology:**  
  Powered by models from OpenAI and integrated with LangChain, this application represents a modern approach to conversational AI in the healthcare domain.
  
- **Clear Medical Disclaimers:**  
  All responses include a disclaimer, ensuring users understand that the information provided is solely for educational purposes and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

## How It Works

1. **Document Preparation & Indexing:**  
   The medical reference PDF is loaded and segmented into overlapping text chunks using a recursive splitter. These chunks are then indexed in an in-memory vector store, enabling fast and relevant retrieval based on user queries.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:**  
   When a user asks a question, the application searches for the most relevant chunks of text in the vector store. The content is then combined with a set of carefully crafted medical instructions (which include empathy, conciseness, and a disclaimer) to generate a precise response.

3. **Appointment Booking Flow:**  
   If a user expresses intent to book an appointment (detected via keywords), the chatbot shifts the conversation to gather the necessary appointment details, simulating a seamless booking process.

4. **Streamlit Interface:**  
   The entire interaction is handled via a Streamlit web app, making the experience interactive, real-time, and easily accessible through a web browser.
